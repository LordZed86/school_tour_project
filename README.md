# School Tour Project

This repo showcases my first major Python GUI project for an Intro to CS class, and my later rebuild using object-oriented programming and a modular design.

## Structure

- `original_version/` — The original, single-file version written during my intro class. Includes GUI, game logic, and save/load all in one.
- `updated_version/` — A complete refactor using OOP principles, proper package structure, and a cleaner interface with map, stats, and modular windows.

## Future Goals

- Fully update structure and logic now that I have learned much more about programming
- Add arrow-key or typed movement support
- Polish inventory and item interactions
- Improve saving/loading and endgame state
